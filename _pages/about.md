Welcome! My name is Jain Choi, and I am a fourth-year PhD student in the Department of Political Science at the University of Florida. My primary field is International Relations, and I work extensively in Political Methodology.

My research focuses on developing and applying quantitative methods to study the behavior of individuals, groups, and states. Methodologically, I employ a range of approaches, including causal inference through survey experiments, Bayesian modeling, and machine learning techniques such as text analysis and random forests. Across projects, I aim to bridge methodological innovation with substantive applications in International Relations.

Substantively, my work is motivated by questions at the intersection of international security and political psychology. I study how citizens perceive marginalized communities, including immigrants, North Korean defectors in South Korea, and sexual minorities, and how these attitudes evolve over time in response to citizens' experiences of suffering.

I received my M.A. in International Relations from Seoul National University and my B.A. in Political Science and International Relations from Chonnam National University. I am a proud native of Busan, South Korea.
