My name is Jain Choi, and I am a fourth-year PhD student in the Department of Political Science at the University of Florida. My primary field is International Relations, and I work extensively in political methodology.

My research focuses on developing and applying quantitative methods to study the behavior of individuals, groups, and states. Methodologically, I employ a range of approaches, including causal inference through survey experiments, Bayesian modeling, and machine learning techniques such as text analysis and random forests. Across projects, I aim to bridge methodological innovation with substantive applications in International Relations.

Substantively, my work is motivated by questions at the intersection of international security and political psychology. I study how citizens perceive marginalized communities, including immigrants, North Korean defectors in South Korea, and sexual minorities, and how these attitudes evolve over time in response to citizens' experiences of suffering.

My dissertation is an article-based project consisting of three papers in political methodology. The first paper, *“Forecasting African Countries’ Participation in UNPKOs with China,”* develops forecasting models to predict state participation in international peacekeeping operations. The second paper, *“Sexual Minorities’ Attitudes toward Immigrants in Europe from a Bayesian Perspective,”* applies Bayesian modeling to study public attitudes toward immigrants among sexual minorities across European countries. The third paper, *“Modeling Vignettes’ Arbitrariness and Respondents’ Complex Reactions in Survey Experiments,”* develops methodological tools to address arbitrariness and complex response patterns in survey-based experimental designs.

I received my M.A. in International Relations from Seoul National University and my B.A. in Political Science and International Relations from Chonnam National University.

My dissertation is an article-based project consisting of three papers in political methodology. These papers develop methodological tools for improving causal inference and measurement in survey-based research, including work on modeling vignette arbitrariness, forecasting political behavior, and integrating machine learning techniques with experimental designs.
