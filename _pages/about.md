My name is Jain Choi, and I am a fourth-year PhD student in the Department of Political Science at the University of Florida. While my primary substantive field is International Relations, my scholarly identity is centered on **political methodology**.

My research focuses on developing and applying quantitative methods to study political behavior, with particular emphasis on survey experiments, causal inference, Bayesian statistics, and computational approaches. Substantively, my work is motivated by questions in international security and political psychology, especially how individuals form and update attitudes toward marginalized communities such as immigrants, North Korean defectors in South Korea, and sexual minorities.

My dissertation is an article-based project consisting of three papers in political methodology. These papers develop methodological tools for improving causal inference and measurement in survey-based research, including work on modeling vignette arbitrariness, forecasting political behavior, and integrating machine learning techniques with experimental designs.

Methodologically, I employ a range of quantitative techniques, including linear and multilevel models, survey experiments, Bayesian modeling, and machine learning methods such as text analysis and random forests. Across projects, I aim to bridge methodological innovation with substantive applications in International Relations.

I received my M.A. in International Relations from Seoul National University and am currently completing my Ph.D. in Political Science at the University of Florida.
