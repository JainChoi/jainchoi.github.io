My dissertation is an article-based project consisting of three papers in political methodology.
The first paper, <em>“Forecasting African Countries’ Participation in UNPKOs with China in Africa,”</em>
develops forecasting models to predict state participation in international peacekeeping operations.
The second paper, <em>“Sexual Minorities’ Attitudes toward Immigrants in Europe from a Bayesian Perspective,”</em>
applies Bayesian modeling to study public attitudes toward immigrants among sexual minorities across European countries.
The third paper, <em>“Modeling Vignettes’ Arbitrariness and Respondents’ Complex Reactions in Survey Experiments,”</em>
develops methodological tools to address arbitrariness and complex response patterns in survey-based experimental designs.
